# Davis Ransom Web Developer Portfolio 

This portfolio is meant to be a work in progress, and as I learn, I will add more and more features, such as emailing me via forms, adding video, and enhancing the look of the webpage.

This project was special for me because it was the very first time that I had ever built a website, and every little detail was a serious challenge, but also a great, hands-on learning experience.

## Stack

The stack I used to create this Portfolio was HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

## Projects

The Shady Marketplace

Oh Snap! Image App
