# Davis Ransom Web Developer Portfolio 

My name is Davis Ransom and I am switching careers from Teaching to Software Development! I am learning so much daily and I aim to become a full-time, employed programmer in 2022.
This portfolio is meant to be a work in progress, and as I learn, I will add more and more features! 

## Stack
The stack I used to create this Portfolio was HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

## Projects

1. The Shady Marketplace
2. Oh Snap! Image App
3. Science Fiction TV Show API
