# Davis Ransom Web Dev Portfolio

## Introduction

This portfolio was made by me, Davis Ransom, during the middle of my first foray into the world of technology: Bootcamp. It is meant to help me build up my skills, demonstrate a bit about who I am, and be a sandbox for my tech capabilities.

## Technologies Used to Make This Portfolio

This portfolio is a static portfolio and was made using HTML, CSS, and Javascript only. I chose not to use a front-end framework like Bootstrap so that I could show my ability to make the site organized, pretty cool looking, and responsive without any other tools.

## Acknowledgments

I would like to thank my tutor and mentor, Ian Marshall, for his support and guidance on this, and many other, projects.

## Questions?

Who is the target audience for this portfolio?

    Anyone who would like to know a little bit more about me as a developer.

Why did you choose to put a map on your portfolio?

    I have been to every state in the United States, other than Hawaii and Alaska. I wanted to show that I have lived on both coasts and that I can adapt to a variety of environments.

What did you enjoy most about this project?

    I loved learning about all of the possibilities that are possible with this kind of project. At first I felt limited but soon I started to feel exctied about the creativity that I can express as I learn more and more!

## Optimization

This project is optimized for a range of devices. It is ideal to view on a larger computer screen, but it looks great on a smalller device like a phone, too.
