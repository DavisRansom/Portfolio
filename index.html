        <h1>About Me</h1>

        <p>Growing up as an athlete, I had dreams of becoming a professional volleyball player and achieved a
            degree of success playing professionally, but a serious back injury ended my chances of playing at a
            high level any more. So, I went into teaching and coaching and have spent the past 25 years doing so
            in various capacities.</p>

        <p>During the pandemic my priorities shifted to focusing on what I really wanted to do with the next
            portion of my life and I started becoming super interested in technology. So, after about a year and
            a half of thinking about it, I decided to jump into UCSD's Full-stack Web Development Bootcamp and I
            have started making some projects!</p>
